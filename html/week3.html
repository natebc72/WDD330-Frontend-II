            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>~ An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ It's very uncommon to use property and method names that don't follow the rules for naming variables.
                     In a real-world app, it's likely the "real name" property would actually be named real_name or realName.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation that we've already seen in previous chapters. This will return the value of that property</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ You can also access an object's properties using bracket notation â€• 
                    the property is represented by a string inside square brackets, so needs to be placed inside single or double quotation marks</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>~ The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ <em>THe DOM also stores any whitespace that is in the HTML document as text nodes.</em></li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Any CSS property names that are separated by dashes must be written in camelCase notation, 
                    so the dash is removed and the next letter is capitalized because dashes are not legal characters in property names.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>~ Event listeners in JavaScript are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens. Instead of the program 
                    having to constantly check to see if an event has occurred, the event listener will let it know when the event happens, and the program can then respond 
                    appropriately. This allows the program to continue with other tasks while it waits for the event to happen.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ The parameter does not have to be called "event". It can be given any legal variable name, although calling it "event" can make it easier to read the code. 
                    Many developers often abbreviate it to just "e".</li>
