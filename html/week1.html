            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <ol>Mobile first is the way to go. Build from the smallest screen up, like in WDD230.</ol>
                <ol>Google says- A 1/2 second delay is a 20% drop in traffic</ol>
                <ol>Mobile is still new, helping the consumers evolve is necessary but we also need to seek to help them now. (Example: Hamburger Button)</ol>
                <ol>Seek to simplify forms. Add fields that make sense. Don't ask for address for an email subscription.</ol>
                <ol>Marketing online is huge nowadays. But popups and huges adds are greatly detested. If add are included we need to try and make sure they <br>
                that they don't take away from screen real estate. Keep them simple. </ol>
                <ol>We need to have new thinking for the new innovations.</ol>
                <ol>Empathy is huge in this game.</ol>
            </ol>
