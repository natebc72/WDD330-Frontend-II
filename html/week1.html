            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mobile first is the way to go. Build from the smallest screen up, like in WDD230.</li>
                <li>Google says- A 1/2 second delay is a 20% drop in traffic</li>
                <li>Mobile is still new, helping the consumers evolve is necessary but we also need to seek to help them now. (Example: Hamburger Button)</li>
                <li>Seek to simplify forms. Add fields that make sense. Don't ask for address for an email subscription.</li>
                <li>Marketing online is huge nowadays. But popups and huges adds are greatly detested. If add are included we need to try and make sure they <br>
                    that they don't take away from screen real estate. Keep them simple. </li>
                <li>We need to have new thinking for the new innovations.</li>
                <li>Empathy is huge in this game.</li>
