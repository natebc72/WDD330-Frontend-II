            <ol>
                <li>~ If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a "cache" property.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ The increase in the use of asynchronous programming in JavaScript has meant that more and more callbacks are being used. This can result in messy and confusing 
                    'spaghetti code'. This is when more than one callback is used in the same function, resulting in a large number of nested blocks that are difficult to comprehend.
                    "Callback hell" is the term used to refer to this tangled mess of code, and it's such a common issue that it even has its own website!</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>~ Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. 
                    This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program 
                    continues to run.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ In the previous example we displayed a message to say we were waiting for a response. It is common for sites to use spinners (or egg timers in the old days!) 
                    to indicate that the site is waiting for something to happen. Ajax Load and Preloaders.net are both good resources for creating a spinner graphic for your site.</li>
