            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>~ Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and any functions
                     are methods of it. In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ These methods were largely responsible for giving JavaScript a bad name, as they were used for creating annoying pop-up windows that usually contained 
                    intrusive advertisements. It's also a bad idea from a usability standpoint to resize or move a user's window. 
                    Many browsers block pop-up windows and disallow some of these methods to be called in certain cases.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ The Screen object has more uses for mobile devices. It also allows you to do things like turn off the device's screen, detect a change in its orientation
                     or lock it in a specific orientation.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used to create web pages. The latest iteration is HTML 5.1, which finally became a W3C recommendation in November 2016.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any 'data-' attributes it contains.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data. 
                    The information is saved in the form of key-value pairs, and the values can only be strings. There is also a sessionStorage object that works in the same way, although the data is only saved 
                    for the current session.</li>
            </ol>
