                <li>~ Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:
                    <br>
                    System error ― there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.
                    <br>
                    Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
                    <br>
                    User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <li>~ Increasing the chance of errors might seem like a bad idea at first, but it's much better to spot errors early on, rather than have them cause problems later. 
                    <br>Writing code in strict mode can also help improve its clarity and speed, since it follows conventions and will throw exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <li>~ Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.</li>
