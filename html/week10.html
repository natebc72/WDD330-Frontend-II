                <li>~ Client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure! Your apps should always perform security checks on any 
                    form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side, because client-side validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users can still 
                    easily send bad data through to your server.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ The novalidate attribute turns off the browser's automatic validation; this lets Javascript take control over validation.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Client-side form validation sometimes requires JavaScript if you want to customize styling and error messages, but it always requires you to think carefully about the user. 
                    Always remember to help your users correct the data they provide. /li>
                <br>
                <li>~ The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the protocol, such as requests and responses. 
                    5It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network./li>
