                <li>~ Forms are a very common method of interacting with a web page. A form is the main component of Google's home page,
                     and most of us use forms every day to log in to our favorite sites.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup.
                     Even though there is only one form in our example, a collection will still be returned, so we have to use index notation to return the first 
                     (and only) form object, like so: <em>const form = document.forms[0];</em>
                    This is the equivalent of using the following method that we learned in chapter 6: <em>const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];</em></li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that's been entered. 
                    So think very carefully before using one in a form.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.</li>
