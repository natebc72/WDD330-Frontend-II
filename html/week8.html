                <li>~Forms are made up of a form element that contains form controls such as input fields, 
                    select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted. (NTN)</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that's
                     been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form. (NTN)</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Transforms don't work on inline elements.(HTML5 & CSS3)</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. (HTML5 & CSS3)</li>
