            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>~ The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities with the C programming language.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Semicolons should be used to separate 2 statements but aren't needed to separate blocks.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ The "let" declaration is to be used instead of "var". Var is for older versions.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Using const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their value only exists inside the block they are declared in.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>~ An array is an ordered list of values.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Numbers are sorted alphabetically</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for writing anonymous functions in ES6.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values provided for the function as an input. There is a subtle 
                    difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the function is defined. When a function is invoked, it is provided with arguments.</li>
                <br>
                <li>~ A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.</li>
